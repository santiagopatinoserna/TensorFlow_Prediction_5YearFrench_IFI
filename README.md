# ðŸš€  Welcome to Godi.AI's Predictive Analysis of IFI Tax for French Cities

Hello, business innovator! ðŸŒŽ I'm [Santiago PATINO SERNA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santiago-patino/), the CEO and data scientist at [Godi.AI](https://godi.ai/). This notebook presents the data reading and processing steps (for a detailed explanation, please refer to this other [Notebook on Github](https://github.com/santiagopatinoserna/5YearFrenchWealthAnalysis/blob/main/Script/Exploration/Data%20Exploration%20and%20Initial%20Analysis.ipynb)). We delve into feature engineering followed by the development of six unique models. Each model's hyperparameters are optimized automatically. Following this, we evaluate each model's performance using cross-validation. With the results in hand, Generative AI steps in to assess the models. Acting as an expert data scientist, Generative AI determines the optimal model for deployment, explaining its selection in depth.

### Predictive Analysis of IFI Tax for French Cities

- **Data Loading:** Initializing necessary libraries and importing the IFI tax dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Transforming raw data into informative features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Development:** Creating six unique models, each with automated hyperparameter optimization.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assessing each model's predictive capability using cross-validation techniques.

### Generative AI Model Analysis

Delve into:
- Comparative analysis of all models' performance.
- Generative AI's role as an expert data scientist in selecting the optimal model.
- A detailed explanation of the chosen model and its implications for deployment.
